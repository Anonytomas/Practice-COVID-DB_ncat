# Practice-COVID-DB_ncat

# What is this?

This is a final project for a first-level database university course. Our 3 person group gradually built this practice COVID database throughout the semester.

* We created an Entity Relationship chart mapping out cardinality and tables.
* We built the tables and practiced inserting data via MariaDB (SQL) scripts.
* We learned to normalize our tables to 3NF / BCNF.
* We implemented SQL statements to showcase table information (joins, lists, etc...).

# How I worked on this project

* I spent the most time creating scripts to import data, correcting SQL errors, and documenting our progress.
* I led the team in building the initial ER chart (our starting point).
* I ensured that the load and SQL files could connect to our HTML/PHP webpage for inserting data.

# Why I built the project this way

* The first step was finding datasets we knew would be available and abundant at the beginning of the semester. COVID was the perfect choice for our project.
* The project scope was dialed back when we realized how tables would interact in the normalization phase.
* The ability to insert data via PHP was an important step in making the process efficient and a requirement for the project.

# If I had more time, I would change this

* I would rebuild the Entity Relationship chart to match the changes we made in the project. This would be good practice for future projects/work. 
* I would add tables with relevant data and expand datasets. Datasets were truncated in this project to keep the project manageable.
* I would modernize the HTML/CSS webpage to improve functionality and appearance.
